# Event Organizer
Developed with insights from Gavin Lon's C# course, Event Organizer was intended to be a comprehensive web application for efficient event management. However, the project has been stopped, and currently, only the functionality for purchasing events remains operational.

Technology Stack:

    Backend: .NET Web API, Entity Framework, PostgreSQL
    Frontend: Blazor WebAssembly
